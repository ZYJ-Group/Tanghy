## Abstract
Abstract—Target three-dimensional reconstruction plays an essential role in the intelligent sensing and recognition of targets. Multichannel inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) can realize target three-dimensional reconstruction by multiple antenna imaging. However, due to the different observation angles of multiple antennas, the scatterer association of different antenna images becomes a serious problem, which will significantly affect the imaging quality and reconstruction accuracy. This article proposes a three-dimensional reconstruction approach for targets based on phase-derived technology. First, the position relation between scatterers is employed to associate different scatterers based on iterative closet point (ICP) point cloud matching, and multiple antenna images are registered. Then, a squint model is established between the observation angle and phase of the target. Interference phase is extracted to estimate observation angles and antenna coordinates. Finally, the three-dimensional coordinate is reconstructed based on the observation angles and antenna coordinates. The proposed method can improve the accuracy of scatterer association and obtain target three-dimensional reconstruction coordinate with high accuracy. Simulation and experiment results based on the measured data demonstrate that the proposed method has high three-dimensional reconstruction accuracy.
